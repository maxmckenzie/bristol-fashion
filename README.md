# Bristol Fashion
Bristol fashion, AKA Bristol for short (but some other dude already took that npm repo). It is a collection of custom made design system utilities, rather than providing developers with a UI framework such as Bootstrap and Foundation. Bristol provides the utilities you need to make your own based on design theory and a little bit of maths.

Bristol fashion, AKA Bristol for short (but some other dude already took that npm repo). It is a collection of custom made design system utilities, rather than providing developers with a UI framework such as Bootstrap and Foundation. Bristol provides the utilities you need to make your own based on design theory and a little bit of maths.

## Install

You can include just the CDN if you would like to https://bristol-fashion.now.sh/styles.css

Including this in your head will include all of the CSS and all of the browser defaults that come with it

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bristol-fashion.now.sh/styles.css">
```

or `yarn add bristol-fashion` or `npm i bristol-fashion` depending on your preference.

## Features

- normalize.css
- Typography utility for type scale calculation and browser defaults
- Color CSS variables broken down into Brand, Pallet, neutral, and UI

### ToDo

- [ ] local dev with yalc
- [ ] Offset Shadows util and defaults
- [ ] Auto color tone calculation
- [ ] Less and Sass Support
- [ ] Stylus support
- [ ] Flexbox grid and spacing (HTML classes)

> Despite being called Bristol, the spelling is international English as that's how computers talk and documentation walks. Not UK English and despite my want to also not in Bristolian. I may well for a laugh translate the docs into Bristolian. But let's get something working first ay!

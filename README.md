# Bristol Fashion
Bristol fashion, AKA Bristol for short (but some other dude already took that npm repo). It is a collection of custom made design system utilities, rather than providing developers with a UI framework such as Bootstrap and Foundation. Bristol provides the utilities you need to make your own based on design theory and a little bit of maths.

# Install

You can include just the CDN if you would like to `https://bristol-fashion.now.sh/styles.css`

or `yarn add bristol-fashion` or `npm i bristol-fashion` depending on your preferance.

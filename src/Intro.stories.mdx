</div>

Bristol fashion, AKA Bristol for short (but some other dude already took that npm repo). It is a collection of custom made design system utilities, rather than providing developers with a UI framework such as Bootstrap and Foundation. Bristol provides the utilities you need to make your own based on design theory and a little bit of maths.

## Features (hopefully)

- [ ] Vertical Rythum typographical scale
- [ ] Color variables are broken down into Brand, Pallet, and UI
- [ ] Auto color tone calculation
- [ ] Less and Sass Support
- [ ] Stylus support
- [ ] Flexbox grid and spacing (HTML classes)

> Despite being called Bristol, the spelling is international English as that's how computers talk and documentation walks. Not UK English and despite my want to also not in Bristolian. I may well for a laugh translate the docs into Bristolian. But let's get something working first ay!

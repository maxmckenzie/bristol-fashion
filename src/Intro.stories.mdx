  # Bristol Fashion

  <span style={{ color: '#546e7a' }}>Design system to help keep UI design ship shape and Bristol fashion</span>
</div>

Bristol fashion, AKA Bristol for short (but some other dude already took that npm repo). It is a collection of custom made design system utilities, rather than providing developers with a UI framework such as Bootstrap and Foundation. Bristol provides the utilities you need to make your own based on design theory and a little bit of maths.

### Github Source

```

or `yarn add bristol-fashion` or `npm i bristol-fashion` depending on your preference.

> Despite being called Bristol, the spelling is international English as that's how computers talk and documentation walks. Not UK English and despite my want to also not in Bristolian. I may well, for a laugh translate the docs into Bristolian. But let's get something working first ay!

# WIP: Typography

> This is a work in pregress you can use the browser default styles, but the functions could do with some more work.

Just including the CSS from the cdn this provides you a set of defaults for h1, h2, h3 etc. there are also two additional classes of `.textSmall` `.textTiny`.

You can also import just the variables, functions and or browser defaults as a utility into your scss or less files. 

To include browser defaults, variables and functions)

```
@import "bristol-fashion/src/typography/typography.css";
```

Include just the utilities and overwrite the variables with your own.

yourFile.[less|scss]
```
:root {
  font-size: 16px;
}

@base-font-size: 1rem;
@base-font-ratio: 1.25; // major second
@type-margin: 0;

@import "bristol-fashion/src/typography/typography-functions.[less|scss]";
@import "bristol-fashion/src/typography/typography.[less|scss]";

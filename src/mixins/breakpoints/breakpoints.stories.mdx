# Breakpoints

Less mixin for different view port widths. to be used inside a less file only with 

`@import 'node_modules/bristol-fashion/src/mixins/breakpoints/breakpoints.less';`

after this you will have the following available.

```
.xs({});
.sm({});
.md({});
.lg({});
.xl({});
.xxl({});
.xxxl({});
```

if you want to over write the defaults just state the variables in less.

```
@import 'node_modules/bristol-fashion/src/mixins/breakpoints/breakpoints.less';

@xs: 320px;
@sm: 20rem;
@md: 30rem;
@lg: 60rem;
@xl: 90rem;
@xxl: 120rem;
@xxxl: 200rem;

// The new values will be used from this point onwards in your styles

```

```
.xs({
  // my extra small styles
});
```

Styles are inherited upwards and if you have made the interface mobile first you should have a structure somethign like.

```
.thing {
  // styles at all screen sizes
  .lg({
    // styles when the screen is wider that 150rem
  });
}

```
